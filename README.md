## Tri's Data Viz Project at Upstatement
This is an **experimental** project to use [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) and other libraries to visualize health indicator data.

### Idea
Visualize [Health Statistics](http://data.worldbank.org/topic/health) through [indicators](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/reports/tableview.aspx) collected by the World Bank using a [Parallel Coordinates system](https://github.com/syntagmatic/parallel-coordinates) and d3.

### Get Started
- Install node and npm
- Run `npm install`
- Run `bower install`

Since all the code is client-side right now, no fancy server setup is needed. The code should just render when `index.html` is opened in the browser.

If there's any error getting this page set up, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/tnguyen14/unagi/issues).
